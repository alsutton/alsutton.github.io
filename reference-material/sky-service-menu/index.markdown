There is a hidden service menu on Sky+ units which gives you access to engineer functions. If you have been having problems recording using the Sky+ system and the screen has been reporting there is a fault it may be worth doing using the system reset option from this menu.


 


_Please Note :_ this WILL loose all of your previous recorded programs and your recording schedule. Once you have performed a full reset, you should wait a couple of minutes before trying to use the Sky+ system.


 


To access the menu push the following buttons on your remote in turn (i.e. press Services, then release the button, then press 4, ....)


 


Services  
4  
0  
1  
Select


 


I do not offer any guarantees, and I do not accept any liability for anything you may do with this menu.
