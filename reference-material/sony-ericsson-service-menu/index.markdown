There is a hidden service menu on the T610 which gives you access to the firmware version numbers for the components of the system. To access it use the following key combination from the "normal" screen (i.e. where you dial a number from)

Move the joystick right
Release the joystick (it should return to the center)
Press *
Move the joystick left
Release the joystick (it should return to the center)
Move the joystick left again
Release the joystick (it should return to the center)
Press *
Move the joystick left
Release the joystick (it should return to the center)
Press *

You should then see a menu with the following options;

Service info
Service settings
Service tests
Text labels

To find your hardware version select Service info, then SW Information from the next menu.

Please do NOT ask me what the latest version is. I do not track releases, I just needed to do this to upgrade my phone once.
