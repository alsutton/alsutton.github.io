      <description>Please Note: Messing around with the firmware and OS on any device can render the device unusable. Please do not attempt to modify your firmware or OS unless you are confident you know what you are doing. I offer no guarantees and do not accept any liability for anything which may go wrong if you follow the information in this post.
Here is my modified version of the instructions from the AOSP page for building for the HTC Dream range of &amp;lsquo;phones to cover the Nexus One Android 2.</description>

      <description>After spending some time trying to build a firmware I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some things which have opened my eyes as to why the Android Open Source Project may not be seeing the kind of community contributions that would be expected of such a high profile project.
Other people have shown an interest in knowing my thoughts so I&amp;rsquo;m going to throw out my top 3 for discussion which will hopefully help to improve things;</description>

      <description>A project I&amp;rsquo;m working on requires the use of a custom firmware image, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to the joy that is trying to build and use the open source version of Android, and to be honest it&amp;rsquo;s left me a little battered.
If you&amp;rsquo;re on an ADP1, and you&amp;rsquo;re just looking to build a 1.6 firmware, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a smooth ride. JBQ and his helpers did a fantastic job and created some easy to follow instructions which you can use to build a firmware image from the donut-plus-aosp branch of the central android repository.</description>
