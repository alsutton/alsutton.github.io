      <description>The New York times is reporting a security flaw in the G1, and to me it&amp;rsquo;s confirmation that Google left opening up the source to public far too late by doing it the day before users could go out and buy hardware with it installed.
If the source code had been available a few months (or even weeks) ago there would have been time for the collective eyeballs of the development community to take a look for problems like the reported one (which was found after a few days) and fix them before the device reached the hands of consumers.</description>
