      <description>After all of the problems with seen with the PayPal X Developer Challenge we&amp;rsquo;re hardly surprised that PortaPayments didn&amp;rsquo;t make it through to the next round.
We have, however, asked for details of the per-entry voting count so that we can see if there were any anomalies in the voting patterns (e.g. 1 or 2 entries with &amp;gt; 50% of the votes), and hopefully I will be able to post these details along with details of any of the final 10 which we identified as not complying with the rules in the near future.</description>
