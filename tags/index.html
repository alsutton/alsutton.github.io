    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Yesterday the Wall Street Journal ran a story about Google planning to hire Android application developers which, to me, seems to have the potential to be the worst possible thing they could do to the Android eco-system. I&rsquo;m going to outline the reasons why I hold this view but I&rsquo;m always open to other, well reasoned, points of view.
The reasons I currently have this view are as follows;
1. It does nothing to help non-Google developers who are currently struggling to make a living from developing Android applications.

I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep this updated with tips and post hints on my twitter account as I get them.
Things you can do something about
Emulated memory size
By default the Honeycomb AVD is created to emulate 256MB of RAM, my advice is to increase this significantly.

      (This was prompted by a question asked by Reto Meier)
As many of you may know my company built and later sold AndAppStore over the course of two years. During that time we kept an eye on the competition and received feedback from users and developers and got a good idea of what both sides wanted. I commented on Google Market because it was the main distribution channel for developers, but I rarely commented on competitors alternative app stores because each of them has their own business plan and all of the legally operating ones seemed to be doing their best to strike a balance between what they need to survive and what users and developers want.

      Some of you may already be familiar with multi-core programming, so a lot of what I&rsquo;m going to cover will be very familiar to you, but some Android developers may have never written for (or considered) how the multiple CPU cores available on CPUs such as Nvidias Tegra 2 chips (as rumoured to be in the Motorola Honeycomb Tablet) can improve the speed of their applications if the applications are written in a multi-core friendly manner.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Since Android 1.6 Google have beenasking developers to use specific size and density groupings for their graphical resources to ensure that their user interfaces looked good on a range of devices, but unfortunately developers are not fully supporting it and now OEMs are making their devices report the wrong densities.
I&rsquo;ve blogged before about developers not supporting the various sizes and densities fully which resulted in UIs which look odd and empty on tablets, but OEMs reporting the wrong densities seems to be a new phenomenon which means even if a developer provided graphic assets for all the screen sizes and densities Android supports they may still see the wrong assets being used and their UI looking odd on some devices through no fault of their own.

      A short while ago I posted about how many Android applications hadn&rsquo;t allowed for tablets by assuming a direct correlation between screen density and screen resolution. I used the Android Facebook application as an example, and as they&rsquo;ve just released an update I thought I should follow up the previous post and look at the changes they&rsquo;ve made. Unfortunately it seems they&rsquo;re heading in the wrong direction.
The biggest backwards step is the removal of landscape mode.

      In the last day or two lots of people have helped circulate a link to an O&rsquo;Reilly effort to create a cookbook of community supplied Android examples, which is a noble effort, but there is a big drawback; and that&rsquo;s the potential quality of the information.
Any healthy community tends to be pyramid shaped when it comes to knowledge and experience. At the bottom are the people who are starting out and have little knowledge or experience of the subject matter, and at the top are the people who&rsquo;ve been involved in the area for a (relatively) long time and have studied it in depth.

      When the Dell Streak was first launched there was an aspect of it that caught me off guard, its' pixel density, and it would appear I&rsquo;m not alone.
Before the Streak developers could pretty much assume that if their app was installed via Google Market any device which reported itself as having low density display (ldpi) had a QVGA screen, any device with a medium density (mdpi) screen had a HVGA screen, and any device with a high density (hdpi) screen had a WVGA screen, and that seemed to work pretty well.

Theres been a fair amount of talk around Googles use of &ldquo;Private APIs&rdquo; in their Android applications since the Andy Rubin interview which appeared in the NY Times Bits blog, and I&rsquo;d like to point out what appears to be a glaring mistake in one of the replies Andy gave.
During the interview he said;
I don&rsquo;t know whether he said this because he doesn&rsquo;t know about what&rsquo;s in some of Googles Android applications, or whether he was towing a party line about Androids' open source nature, but that statement simply isn&rsquo;t true.

If you&rsquo;re on an ADP1, and you&rsquo;re just looking to build a 1.6 firmware, you&rsquo;re in for a smooth ride. JBQ and his helpers did a fantastic job and created some easy to follow instructions which you can use to build a firmware image from the donut-plus-aosp branch of the central android repository.

The discussion started rolling when a patch to add multi-touch functionality on Android was posted on the android-platform mailing list, and ran in parallel another list directly discussing the impact the patent may have, but surprisingly ended up with a post from a Google employee saying that patents should not be discussed on any of the google hosted android lists, and this was further expanded by another Google employee saying that it was &ldquo;because of legal repercussions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it is simply best not to know about them&rdquo;.

      The G1 has been around a few weeks, it&rsquo;s billed as &ldquo;The phone that&rsquo;s built for the internet&rdquo;, but it would appear that the G1 isn&rsquo;t built for email which many people consider as being one of the most useful things on the internet for over 35 years.
The G1 has two in-built Email clients; one is for Googles' GMail, the other is for accounts with whichever ISP you&rsquo;re with. Personally after seeing several stories of problems with Google locking accounts (see here, here, and here for a few) I&rsquo;d prefer to stay with my ISP, but that leaves me with an Email client which is being described by other G1 users as &ldquo;the most pathetic attempt I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo; and &ldquo;frustrating&rdquo;, views which I wholeheartedly agree with.

The reasons I currently have this view are as follows;
1. It does nothing to help non-Google developers who are currently struggling to make a living from developing Android applications.

      Since Android 1.6 Google have beenasking developers to use specific size and density groupings for their graphical resources to ensure that their user interfaces looked good on a range of devices, but unfortunately developers are not fully supporting it and now OEMs are making their devices report the wrong densities.
I&rsquo;ve blogged before about developers not supporting the various sizes and densities fully which resulted in UIs which look odd and empty on tablets, but OEMs reporting the wrong densities seems to be a new phenomenon which means even if a developer provided graphic assets for all the screen sizes and densities Android supports they may still see the wrong assets being used and their UI looking odd on some devices through no fault of their own.

Any healthy community tends to be pyramid shaped when it comes to knowledge and experience. At the bottom are the people who are starting out and have little knowledge or experience of the subject matter, and at the top are the people who&rsquo;ve been involved in the area for a (relatively) long time and have studied it in depth.

You start a worldwide PR campaign, you make a mock-up available so people become familiar with your product, you run a worldwide competition for people to come up with uses for your product, and then you announce launch dates in one country for one date, another for a month later, a few more next year, and, well everyone else, you&rsquo;ll have to wait and see what happens.

      The G1 has been around a few weeks, it&rsquo;s billed as &ldquo;The phone that&rsquo;s built for the internet&rdquo;, but it would appear that the G1 isn&rsquo;t built for email which many people consider as being one of the most useful things on the internet for over 35 years.
The G1 has two in-built Email clients; one is for Googles' GMail, the other is for accounts with whichever ISP you&rsquo;re with. Personally after seeing several stories of problems with Google locking accounts (see here, here, and here for a few) I&rsquo;d prefer to stay with my ISP, but that leaves me with an Email client which is being described by other G1 users as &ldquo;the most pathetic attempt I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo; and &ldquo;frustrating&rdquo;, views which I wholeheartedly agree with.

      Yesterday the Wall Street Journal ran a story about Google planning to hire Android application developers which, to me, seems to have the potential to be the worst possible thing they could do to the Android eco-system. I&rsquo;m going to outline the reasons why I hold this view but I&rsquo;m always open to other, well reasoned, points of view.
The reasons I currently have this view are as follows;
1. It does nothing to help non-Google developers who are currently struggling to make a living from developing Android applications.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Since Android 1.6 Google have beenasking developers to use specific size and density groupings for their graphical resources to ensure that their user interfaces looked good on a range of devices, but unfortunately developers are not fully supporting it and now OEMs are making their devices report the wrong densities.
I&rsquo;ve blogged before about developers not supporting the various sizes and densities fully which resulted in UIs which look odd and empty on tablets, but OEMs reporting the wrong densities seems to be a new phenomenon which means even if a developer provided graphic assets for all the screen sizes and densities Android supports they may still see the wrong assets being used and their UI looking odd on some devices through no fault of their own.

Theres been a fair amount of talk around Googles use of &ldquo;Private APIs&rdquo; in their Android applications since the Andy Rubin interview which appeared in the NY Times Bits blog, and I&rsquo;d like to point out what appears to be a glaring mistake in one of the replies Andy gave.
During the interview he said;
I don&rsquo;t know whether he said this because he doesn&rsquo;t know about what&rsquo;s in some of Googles Android applications, or whether he was towing a party line about Androids' open source nature, but that statement simply isn&rsquo;t true.

The discussion started rolling when a patch to add multi-touch functionality on Android was posted on the android-platform mailing list, and ran in parallel another list directly discussing the impact the patent may have, but surprisingly ended up with a post from a Google employee saying that patents should not be discussed on any of the google hosted android lists, and this was further expanded by another Google employee saying that it was &ldquo;because of legal repercussions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it is simply best not to know about them&rdquo;.

      Some people have noticed some niggles with the Android Honeycomb Previewemulator, so I&rsquo;ve put together a few tips which may help improve your experience.
I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep this updated with tips and post hints on my twitter account as I get them.
Things you can do something about
Emulated memory size
By default the Honeycomb AVD is created to emulate 256MB of RAM, my advice is to increase this significantly.

First off, there is the cost of the &lsquo;phone. At Apples WWDC it was announced that in the US;
3G 8GB goes from $199 to $99. 3GS 16GB to be $199 (same as old price for 3G 8GB) 3GS 32GB to be $299 (same as old price for 3G 16GB).

      In recent days there the issue of the US patent obtained by Apple relating to the multi-touch functionality has reared it&rsquo;s head on the Android development lists, and the discussions have left me deeply concerned about whether Android will ever become a serious global player in the mobile OS market.
The discussion started rolling when a patch to add multi-touch functionality on Android was posted on the android-platform mailing list, and ran in parallel another list directly discussing the impact the patent may have, but surprisingly ended up with a post from a Google employee saying that patents should not be discussed on any of the google hosted android lists, and this was further expanded by another Google employee saying that it was &ldquo;because of legal repercussions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it is simply best not to know about them&rdquo;.

      The G1 has been around a few weeks, it&rsquo;s billed as &ldquo;The phone that&rsquo;s built for the internet&rdquo;, but it would appear that the G1 isn&rsquo;t built for email which many people consider as being one of the most useful things on the internet for over 35 years.
The G1 has two in-built Email clients; one is for Googles' GMail, the other is for accounts with whichever ISP you&rsquo;re with. Personally after seeing several stories of problems with Google locking accounts (see here, here, and here for a few) I&rsquo;d prefer to stay with my ISP, but that leaves me with an Email client which is being described by other G1 users as &ldquo;the most pathetic attempt I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo; and &ldquo;frustrating&rdquo;, views which I wholeheartedly agree with.

There is an alternative though, you can buy a simple pay as you go SIM, use it in your Three broadband modem, and pay 10, 15, or 25 pounds for a 1, 3, or 7 Gigabyte allowance.

As many of you may know my company built and later sold AndAppStore over the course of two years. During that time we kept an eye on the competition and received feedback from users and developers and got a good idea of what both sides wanted. I commented on Google Market because it was the main distribution channel for developers, but I rarely commented on competitors alternative app stores because each of them has their own business plan and all of the legally operating ones seemed to be doing their best to strike a balance between what they need to survive and what users and developers want.

Which started to raise some concerns. It had widely been predicted that we&rsquo;d see Android making it&rsquo;s way onto netbooks in the near future, but with this one announcement that idea has taken a huge knock backwards.
The reason is simple; Androids design is primarily focused on touch screen devices, Chrome OS is focused on netbooks, and netbooks rarely (if ever) have a touch screen.

Before the Streak developers could pretty much assume that if their app was installed via Google Market any device which reported itself as having low density display (ldpi) had a QVGA screen, any device with a medium density (mdpi) screen had a HVGA screen, and any device with a high density (hdpi) screen had a WVGA screen, and that seemed to work pretty well.

      A short while ago I posted about how many Android applications hadn&rsquo;t allowed for tablets by assuming a direct correlation between screen density and screen resolution. I used the Android Facebook application as an example, and as they&rsquo;ve just released an update I thought I should follow up the previous post and look at the changes they&rsquo;ve made. Unfortunately it seems they&rsquo;re heading in the wrong direction.
The biggest backwards step is the removal of landscape mode.

      Over recent weeks there has been a lot of speculation over when Android users will be able to buy applications from Googles Market, but some of the terms and conditions in the Developer Distribution Agreement could scare many developers away before they deploy their first application.
The first thing that came to light is that purchasers will have 24 hours in which they can get a refund apparently with no questions asked.

      Android developers have been waiting for the ability to list pay-for applications in Googles Market, but now most of them wish it had never arrived because the experience it&rsquo;s giving users may just turn them off Android forever.
The first joy is the &ldquo;copy protection&rdquo; offered by Google. Developers can turn this on for their apps but doing so can stop a the application running at all regardless of if it&rsquo;s been copied.

Theres been a fair amount of talk around Googles use of &ldquo;Private APIs&rdquo; in their Android applications since the Andy Rubin interview which appeared in the NY Times Bits blog, and I&rsquo;d like to point out what appears to be a glaring mistake in one of the replies Andy gave.
During the interview he said;
I don&rsquo;t know whether he said this because he doesn&rsquo;t know about what&rsquo;s in some of Googles Android applications, or whether he was towing a party line about Androids' open source nature, but that statement simply isn&rsquo;t true.

Some of you may wonder why I&rsquo;ve stopped updating a previous post with the current percentage of votes PortaPayments has in the PayPal X Developers challenge. There&rsquo;s a simple reason; PayPal have taken away the ability to see how many votes have been cast.
Whether this has something to do with a sudden leap of 1,000 cast votes over 24 hours a couple of days ago, or being able to see that even though they sent out an email stating they were aware of &ldquo;Incentivized voting&rdquo; they hadn&rsquo;t actually penalised anyone for it, or it could be related to me pointing out that, at one point, the system was showing more votes than users (despite each user only suppose to be able to cast 1 vote), or possibly even if it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t like the fact people are making stats about voting available, is completely unknown.

      [Declaration of interest: My company runs AndAppStore, an alternative to Googles Android Market]
Theres been a fair amount of talk around Googles use of &ldquo;Private APIs&rdquo; in their Android applications since the Andy Rubin interview which appeared in the NY Times Bits blog, and I&rsquo;d like to point out what appears to be a glaring mistake in one of the replies Andy gave.
During the interview he said;
I don&rsquo;t know whether he said this because he doesn&rsquo;t know about what&rsquo;s in some of Googles Android applications, or whether he was towing a party line about Androids' open source nature, but that statement simply isn&rsquo;t true.

      First off the good. AppBackr. They came second, and as far as I&rsquo;m aware they didn&rsquo;t break any rules. I&rsquo;ve personally sent them a congratulatory message and everyone who took part in making PortaPayments sees them as a honest, worthy winner. In the future I&rsquo;d have no problems in working with them to help them help apps get funded with a tie-up via AndAppStore or help getting the word out to Android developers.

Well, if you&rsquo;re PayPal, that&rsquo;ll be 11.
And as for &ldquo;gross abuses&rdquo;, well, apparently &ldquo;incentivized voting&rdquo; (i.e. offering rewards for votes) isn&rsquo;t a gross abuse (or certainly doesn&rsquo;t appear to be enough of a gross abuse to warrant doing anything about), which I&rsquo;m sure is something that any entrant into a voting process would be interested to hear.

      I thought that on the final day of voting it would be worth recapping the &ldquo;experience&rdquo; which has been our listing as a PayPal X Developers Challenge finalist. For us there are statistics which, to us, indicate that something has not been quite right with the way the contest has been run. These are;
  PortaPayments was featured in the PayPal FOWA Presentation.
  PortaPayments wasrecommended in one of the largest on-line Android blogs (Android Guys), and that article was re-tweeted and re-used on other sites.

      [Update: Within 12 hours of making this post PayPal made the voting stats public again, briefly, and then they dissapeared once more]
Some of you may wonder why I&rsquo;ve stopped updating a previous post with the current percentage of votes PortaPayments has in the PayPal X Developers challenge. There&rsquo;s a simple reason; PayPal have taken away the ability to see how many votes have been cast.
Whether this has something to do with a sudden leap of 1,000 cast votes over 24 hours a couple of days ago, or being able to see that even though they sent out an email stating they were aware of &ldquo;Incentivized voting&rdquo; they hadn&rsquo;t actually penalised anyone for it, or it could be related to me pointing out that, at one point, the system was showing more votes than users (despite each user only suppose to be able to cast 1 vote), or possibly even if it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t like the fact people are making stats about voting available, is completely unknown.

      Some of you may already be familiar with multi-core programming, so a lot of what I&rsquo;m going to cover will be very familiar to you, but some Android developers may have never written for (or considered) how the multiple CPU cores available on CPUs such as Nvidias Tegra 2 chips (as rumoured to be in the Motorola Honeycomb Tablet) can improve the speed of their applications if the applications are written in a multi-core friendly manner.
