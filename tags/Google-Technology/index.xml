      <description>If you want to have your application listed in Androids Marketplace the first thing you have to do is pay them $25. That&amp;rsquo;s right, even if you&amp;rsquo;re developing a free application for their open platform to list on their &amp;ldquo;user-driven&amp;rdquo; marketplace, it&amp;rsquo;s going to cost you a $25 entry fee.
Do you have an app you&amp;rsquo;d like to to sell?, well, if you make a sale via the Marketplace, that&amp;rsquo;ll be another 30% (yes, thirty percent) of your sales going to them.</description>
