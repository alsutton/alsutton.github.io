      <description>Buying disks has, if anything, become more confusing recently. Gone are the days when the only question was 2.5&amp;quot; or 3.5&amp;quot;, now there are hardware and software interfaces to worry about as well.

2.5&amp;quot; or 3.5&amp;quot; These two are relatively simple; They refer to the physical size of the disk housing (the thing which contains the disk itself), and the connector is, for anything recent, SATA.</description>
