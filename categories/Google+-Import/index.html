        Importing Devices

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I&rsquo;ve often wondered if people who recommend importing devices which are only available in specific countries realise it&rsquo;s a self-defeating practice.
Companies monitor sales through channels, they don&rsquo;t know where the end customers are. So if, for example, there&rsquo;s a product only available in US, and you buy it from a US-based supplier, the company producing that product sees it as a US sale rather than one for the country you&rsquo;re in.

If you go beyond hardware there&rsquo;s things like Voice, All Access Music, and I&rsquo;m sure a number of other products which, if you&rsquo;re not in the US, you&rsquo;re not likely to be able to use.

      Nearly 8 months ago I met with a few software engineers working from some rented desks in San Francisco. They were the +OUYA engineering team. We talked, they took me through their interview process. I also had a meeting with Julie Uhrman, after which I went from being a believer that it could happen to a believer that it would happen and there was a place on the team for me and I could help make it happen.

There are going to be several tracks at #DroidconUK13 , and each track has a track-master, a person who has volunteered to co-ordinate the track, sort out who talks in which slots, and make sure their track is appealing to developers.

      So if I understand this TechCrunch article correctly; +Overdose Caffeine stopped developing for the +OUYA because they don&rsquo;t want to implement a control system which works well with an OUYA controller (and the article reads very much like they may have received an incentive to highlight another product)
To me this article highlights one part of the value of the OUYA store; It stops users getting apps from developers who don&rsquo;t understand the UX needs of a console.

      I know this is going to be unpopular, but I think Facebook have got their Developer Relations working pretty well.
Rather than expect developers to pay to fly and stay near them, they&rsquo;re setting up conferences around the world. That way you know you&rsquo;re going to get locally relevant content and not pay a few thousand bucks to be told you can&rsquo;t get access to some of the key technologies because you live in the wrong place.

This means I&rsquo;m now definitely going to give it a skip it in favour of +Droidcon Berlin and +droidcon London later in the year. Whilst I&rsquo;ve had some good conversations at #io events I&rsquo;ve also had a number of ones which left me thinking &ldquo;OK, this person isn&rsquo;t really into coding and technology&rdquo;, whereas at the Droidcons I&rsquo;ve been to the only time I&rsquo;ve thought that was talking to some of the people who have stands and are clearly identifiable as sales people (usually wearing a company T-shirt or something similar).

      So now people are expecting a Chromebook Pixel and an X-Phone as giveaways at #io13 . If it&rsquo;s open ticket sales again this year I can see the developer attendee count going down and the freebie hunter count going up.
At #io12 I met a guy who guy who said he was getting two of everything because he bought a ticket for himself and one for his son. His son was at college studying English, had no interest in the freebies, but took up the offer of a free trip to San Francisco in return for turning up to pick-up the goodies at the times his Dad told him to.

      Looks like +Google have done it again; Completely f&rsquo;ed up when writing a simple order management system.
I&rsquo;m seeing numerous reports from people who ordered #Nexus4 &rsquo;s after me and were told it would arrive in &ldquo;4-5 weeks&rdquo; that they&rsquo;ve received their &lsquo;phones, which my order (made about 3 minutes after the 4th of Dec restock, with a &ldquo;1-2 week&rdquo; estimate) is still sitting in &ldquo;Pending&rdquo;.
Every #IO ticket ordering session for the past couple of years has been a disaster, the initial #Nexus4 seemed to be a road crash, and this time, although you could order, the order execution process seems to be completely screwed, and in traditional Google style, all you have is an email address to get an answer from and, if they deem you worthy, you might actually get a reply.

The feel of the device reminds me very much of a Xoom. The rubber back is a good touch (I can&rsquo;t count how many samsung tablets I&rsquo;ve had slip around in my hands).
In terms of setup, it still disappoints me that +Android doesn&rsquo;t show the MAC address when you set up WiFi for the first time.

Personally I felt it was this years attempt to reassure users their devices would get updates after last years attempt (The 18 month update guarantee) failed so miserably.

This has been true for a long time. Consumers buy devices from washing machines to TVs because they want it to do something, not because it has the lastest bit of technology from the manufacturer.

      One of the changes in #IceCreamSandwich was the introduction of a lower SMS usage monitor rate which restricts how many SMSes can be sent by any application in a given time.
My guess would be that the aim is to prevent malicious apps sending huge amounts of SMSes to premium rate numbers, but unfortunately some users seem to be hitting the limit with the default SMS messaging app (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-discuss/bsDO0jQVdTI/Ns7oaTCcIa8J), and it&rsquo;s possible developers may see users complaining about this if their apps rely on SMS usage and are heavily used, so I thought it&rsquo;s worth letting people what the limits are in case people ask them.

      TL;DR: Implementing it in your apps is more hassle than it&rsquo;s worth.
To answer the most common question; Yes, the two apps on one screen functionality of the Galaxy Note 10.1 is limited to a few apps. All of them ship with the device.
The code to support multi-window mode is baked into the core Android framework on the device (so much so that the classes are in the framework library odex), which means that it could be submitted to the #AOSP to become part of Androids core functionality.

Hopefully my posts messing around with the NexusQ have shown you that it is just an #Android device and that most apps would work on it with little to no effort as long as they don&rsquo;t require things like a camera or multi-touch input. If the Q were combined with a simple control system (e.g. an app on the phone which worked as a touchpad for the Q) you&rsquo;d have yourself, in my opinion, one of the best Android living room experiences currently available.

      After chatting with +Billy Rutledge yesterday I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas spinning for how people could use the #NexusQ so I thought I&rsquo;d put them out there as they seem to revolve around one theme; The Q as a hub device.
Multiplayer gaming could use it as the server/co-ordinator for multiple devices running on the same WiFi network so that no-ones individual device needs to be nominated as the primary device (and take the processing hit), and any peer-to-peer co-ordination alogrithms could be offloaded onto the Q creating a star topology instead of a mesh, which tends to be more efficient.

      t&rsquo;s now over 6 months (OK, 6 months and 1 day) since the #GalaxyNexus was launched in the UK.
Even if the Android release cycle was stretched out to one release every 12 months that means we&rsquo;re half way through a release cycle and currently the installed base is around 5% of devices.
5%, or 1 in 20 devices, is a small percentage of the market. To put this in context developers could extend the appeal of their apps to more end users by translating English apps into Korean than by adding ICS features.

      Today I found out that the AppsLib Android application directory is distributing one of my companies apps against our wishes.
They&rsquo;ve provided no method for removing the app, no method for closing the account they&rsquo;ve created under our name, and I suspect that we&rsquo;re not the only company they&rsquo;ve done this to. The email address for the account is our support email address, but we&rsquo;ve never received an account confirmation email or any indication it was being used in this way.

      If been playing with the Xbox360 and its voice control using the Kinect and it&rsquo;s sparked an idea in my head which I thought I&rsquo;d post here for comments; What would people think if there was a setting in Android which took you straight into a voice control screen from an unlock?
This would allow users to do things like unlock their device with facial recognition then speak to their phone to get it to do things like dialling home, sending texts, emailing, etc.

      As you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, I&rsquo;m impressed with the iPhone. Given the tests I&rsquo;ve been doing over the last week I can see why it is an aspirational device. Apps have a consistent feel and are wide ranging, the device is easily portable, it has a pretty decent camera, and it just comes together in a pretty simple to use package.
I&rsquo;m also pleasantly surprised by Lumia. It falls short in terms of the variety of apps available, but Windows Phone 7 is only a year or so away from it&rsquo;s public launch, so that&rsquo;s to be expected.

      I&rsquo;d be interested to hear peoples thoughts on going to IO next year. Last year was the first year I went and, although it was a fantastic experience, I&rsquo;m in two minds about going this year.
Basically my thinking is;
Sessions; Useful but streamed so I could see them anyway
People; Largely thought provoking, but I could meet most of them at more local events.
Giveaways; They have monetary value, but aren&rsquo;t enough of a reason for me to go (I hardly use the giveaways from IO2011).

      I know some of the people who follow me work for companies who make/brand/sell Android devices, so I&rsquo;m going to put this out there and hope it&rsquo;s useful to them.
There are a number of developers (me included) who see the Nexus One as the pinnacle of current Android devices. It&rsquo;s size, solid construction, and reliability made it a device we could carry knowing that it&rsquo;d work when we need it.

  Don&rsquo;t expect it to run well on any machine with less than 3GB of RAM. It can be done, but don&rsquo;t rely on it :).
  There is a list of know issues in the emulator at http://tools.android.com/knownissues (from @ediTLJ on twitter)
  Increase the default RAM for your AVDs to 1024MB (yup, 1GB)
  If the emulator has crashed try deleting the AVD you used.

      Given the announcement due tomorrow I think we&rsquo;re going to be looking at consumers being able to get their hands on an Ice Cream Sandwich device before developers have had a good chance to play with an SDK, which, just like the last time this happened, is pretty disappointing.
There isn&rsquo;t really anyone who wins from this because it creates a situation where consumers get their new shiny &lsquo;phone only to find out that all the latest features are only supported by a few apps which are either preloaded (in the case of the G-apps), or they come across in Market by chance and are from a select few privileged developers.

  Fragments are the future. If you&rsquo;re writing new code use Fragments. If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.
  Avoid showAsAction=&ldquo;always&rdquo;, Ice Cream Sandwich &lsquo;phones can have small screens and so could be limited on space for options.
  Most of the best apps come from teams with Developers and Designers on them.

      Disheartened to admit that I&rsquo;ve just had to recommend a current iPhone user upgrades to another iPhone instead of switching to Android.
Reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.
  They&rsquo;re a power user, not a &ldquo;geek&rdquo;, so availability of apps &amp; media is probably more important than customisation. (There is no equivalent to iTunes for obtaining Movies, TV shows, and Music in one place on Android outside the US, and many main stream apps appear as iOS first releases in the UK)
