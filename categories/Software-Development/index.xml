      <description>After making yesterdays post on how to build the Android Open Source Project master branch using Mac OS X 10.7 and Xcode 4 I&amp;rsquo;ve tracked down what&amp;rsquo;s necessary to get the Ice Cream Sandwich branch of AOSP compiling on the same platform.
This process has been tested against the android-4.0.3_r1 branch, so if you&amp;rsquo;re using another branch you may encounter some issues not mentioned here.
  Follow steps 1 to 4 from the instructions from yesterdays post, but check out the relevant ICS branch instead of master (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to apply the patches from that post to the checked out ICS files).</description>

      <description>[Update: The patches have been merged into the AOSP master branch, so as of the 22nd of December AOSP master should compile on OS X 10.7 with Xcode 4 straight from checkout]
My company has worked on some Android firmware projects in the past, but, due to the closed source nature of Honeycomb, that work pretty much dried up. Recently though Google released Android 4.0 to the masses and we&amp;rsquo;ve had a few enquiries about firmware work again, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see what the current state of building Android was for our default machine configuration.</description>

      <title>PayPal X Contest Winners - Good &amp; Very Bad.</title>

      <description>First off the good. AppBackr. They came second, and as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware they didn&amp;rsquo;t break any rules. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally sent them a congratulatory message and everyone who took part in making PortaPayments sees them as a honest, worthy winner. In the future I&amp;rsquo;d have no problems in working with them to help them help apps get funded with a tie-up via AndAppStore or help getting the word out to Android developers.</description>

      <description>After certain events in recent weeks I thought it was worth putting up a post trying to encourage people to be more constructive in their criticisms.
Take, for example, a conversation I had with a developer a few weeks ago who came from a Symbian background;
Dev : I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a code examples for things like&amp;hellip; how to change screens using a horizontal finger gesture on the screen on Android.</description>

      <description>If you ran a competition and stated that;
How many entries would you expect to find in the next round?
Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re PayPal, that&amp;rsquo;ll be 11.
And as for &amp;ldquo;gross abuses&amp;rdquo;, well, apparently &amp;ldquo;incentivized voting&amp;rdquo; (i.e. offering rewards for votes) isn&amp;rsquo;t a gross abuse (or certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be enough of a gross abuse to warrant doing anything about), which I&amp;rsquo;m sure is something that any entrant into a voting process would be interested to hear.</description>

      <description>After spending some time trying to build a firmware I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some things which have opened my eyes as to why the Android Open Source Project may not be seeing the kind of community contributions that would be expected of such a high profile project.
Other people have shown an interest in knowing my thoughts so I&amp;rsquo;m going to throw out my top 3 for discussion which will hopefully help to improve things;</description>

      <description>A project I&amp;rsquo;m working on requires the use of a custom firmware image, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to the joy that is trying to build and use the open source version of Android, and to be honest it&amp;rsquo;s left me a little battered.
If you&amp;rsquo;re on an ADP1, and you&amp;rsquo;re just looking to build a 1.6 firmware, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a smooth ride. JBQ and his helpers did a fantastic job and created some easy to follow instructions which you can use to build a firmware image from the donut-plus-aosp branch of the central android repository.</description>

      <description>After all of the problems with seen with the PayPal X Developer Challenge we&amp;rsquo;re hardly surprised that PortaPayments didn&amp;rsquo;t make it through to the next round.
We have, however, asked for details of the per-entry voting count so that we can see if there were any anomalies in the voting patterns (e.g. 1 or 2 entries with &amp;gt; 50% of the votes), and hopefully I will be able to post these details along with details of any of the final 10 which we identified as not complying with the rules in the near future.</description>

      <description>I thought that on the final day of voting it would be worth recapping the &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; which has been our listing as a PayPal X Developers Challenge finalist. For us there are statistics which, to us, indicate that something has not been quite right with the way the contest has been run. These are;
  PortaPayments was featured in the PayPal FOWA Presentation.
  PortaPayments wasrecommended in one of the largest on-line Android blogs (Android Guys), and that article was re-tweeted and re-used on other sites.</description>

      <description>[Update: Within 12 hours of making this post PayPal made the voting stats public again, briefly, and then they dissapeared once more]
Some of you may wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped updating a previous post with the current percentage of votes PortaPayments has in the PayPal X Developers challenge. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason; PayPal have taken away the ability to see how many votes have been cast.
Whether this has something to do with a sudden leap of 1,000 cast votes over 24 hours a couple of days ago, or being able to see that even though they sent out an email stating they were aware of &amp;ldquo;Incentivized voting&amp;rdquo; they hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually penalised anyone for it, or it could be related to me pointing out that, at one point, the system was showing more votes than users (despite each user only suppose to be able to cast 1 vote), or possibly even if it&amp;rsquo;s because they don&amp;rsquo;t like the fact people are making stats about voting available, is completely unknown.</description>

      <description>[This body of this post was updated on the at 08:45 GMT - 28th Feb 10 with the latest statistics]
When we entered the PayPal X Developers Challenge we hoped for a good result (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t when they enter a competition?). After the problems we saw with the way it&amp;rsquo;s being run we decided to use the number of votes we received to determine what to do with the project in the future.</description>

      <description>Update : I&amp;rsquo;ve put a list of 17 apps out of the current 54 which we believe don&amp;rsquo;t comply with the rules. You can find the list here.
Towards the middle of December 2009 I came across details of the PayPal X Developer Challenge, which is a contest to write apps using PayPals adaptive APIs. There were two prizes, one of $50,000 cash + $50,000 in PayPal fees, the other $25,000 cash + $25,000 in fees.</description>

      <description>Over recent weeks there has been a lot of speculation over when Android users will be able to buy applications from Googles Market, but some of the terms and conditions in the Developer Distribution Agreement could scare many developers away before they deploy their first application.
The first thing that came to light is that purchasers will have 24 hours in which they can get a refund apparently with no questions asked.</description>

      <title>Will US Patent laws strange Android?</title>

      <description>In recent days there the issue of the US patent obtained by Apple relating to the multi-touch functionality has reared it&amp;rsquo;s head on the Android development lists, and the discussions have left me deeply concerned about whether Android will ever become a serious global player in the mobile OS market.
The discussion started rolling when a patch to add multi-touch functionality on Android was posted on the android-platform mailing list, and ran in parallel another list directly discussing the impact the patent may have, but surprisingly ended up with a post from a Google employee saying that patents should not be discussed on any of the google hosted android lists, and this was further expanded by another Google employee saying that it was &amp;ldquo;because of legal repercussions&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;it is simply best not to know about them&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve taken an interest in Googles Android platform before you&amp;rsquo;ll be familiar with phrases such as &amp;ldquo;Android is the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices&amp;rdquo; from when the Android and Open Handset Alliance initiative was started, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve attended talks by some of the Evangelists you&amp;rsquo;ll have been told that you can replace any part of the &amp;lsquo;phones software, but, this morning, it would appear that you won&amp;rsquo;t be on a level playing field.</description>

      <title>Same Scam... Different Audience</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been subscribed to the development and discussion mailing lists for Googles Android platform due to working on AndAppStore.com and recently an email posting caught my eye because it reminded me of a scam that I thought had long since passed.
The scam works like this; A person or company comes along and says &amp;ldquo;Hey, you&amp;rsquo;re really talented, I&amp;rsquo;d love to sign you up so I can offer you some great projects to work on, and, of course, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get a share of the profits&amp;rdquo;, which is indeed a good offer.</description>

      <title>Is the maven repository creaking at the seams and starting to blow</title>

      <description>This one is a bit of a post for the techies, so if you&amp;rsquo;re more interested in the business side of my blog you may want to skip this post.
 One of the things that, on paper, Apache Maven appears to do well is dependency handling. It checks down the dependency chain to verify that libraries versions match up, and that the latest library is used&amp;hellip;.. except with the current repository it isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to work, and you can easily end up with multiple versions of the same jar on your classpath and not know about it.</description>
