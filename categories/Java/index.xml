      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who&amp;rsquo;ve been using Java long enough to have written it off as not being able to present a good graphical front end, that was until I saw this post at Java Lobby (The video in the post is available directly from YouTube, be aware, it has a techno soundtrack).
None of these cut it against the current generation of PC games, and I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into a few of these games, and some of them semi-cheat by using JNI to call through to native APIs such as OpenGL, so portability is questionable,Â but the achievements of a working AI, physics, and game processing models at speeds which don&amp;rsquo;t impact gameplay is pretty impressive, particularly as they are not produced by large multi-million dollar games development houses.</description>

      <description>Wired have featured the efforts to help make a Java based version of Netscape Communicator which features a couple of quotes from me.
The interview was conducted purely by Email, which is great given the timezone difference, and hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll attract a few extra developers to work on the project.</description>
