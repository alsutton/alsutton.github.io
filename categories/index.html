      Everyone knows that in advertising there is a certain amount of creativity, and that there are bounds to what most companies would consider responsible advertising, but I&rsquo;ve come across a company which seems to be willing to set the borders of responsible advertising a little wider than most.
 The company is Crest Nicholson, a UK house builder, who, in web pages that are thinly disguised adverts for two of their developments (here and here) have large glowing quotes about how good these developments are and the company in general.

      After making yesterdays post on how to build the Android Open Source Project master branch using Mac OS X 10.7 and Xcode 4 I&rsquo;ve tracked down what&rsquo;s necessary to get the Ice Cream Sandwich branch of AOSP compiling on the same platform.
This process has been tested against the android-4.0.3_r1 branch, so if you&rsquo;re using another branch you may encounter some issues not mentioned here.
  Follow steps 1 to 4 from the instructions from yesterdays post, but check out the relevant ICS branch instead of master (Don&rsquo;t forget to apply the patches from that post to the checked out ICS files).

My company has worked on some Android firmware projects in the past, but, due to the closed source nature of Honeycomb, that work pretty much dried up. Recently though Google released Android 4.0 to the masses and we&rsquo;ve had a few enquiries about firmware work again, so I thought I&rsquo;d see what the current state of building Android was for our default machine configuration.

      After seeing a twitter post asking about HTTP MultiPart on Android which linked to a Google Groups thread which recommended a solution which required the inclusion of multiple libraries, I thought it might be worth sharing a method I&rsquo;ve used in the past which can be used reasonably easily and doesn&rsquo;t require tens of kilobytes of unused library functions to be added to your app.
First off you&rsquo;ll need the AOSP source which can be obtained from an unofficial mirror in the absence of the primary official repository at kernel.

I&rsquo;m disheartened to admit that I&rsquo;ve just had to recommend a current iPhone user upgrades to another iPhone instead of switching to Android.
Reasons high-level reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.
  They&rsquo;re a power user, not a &ldquo;geek&rdquo;, so availability of apps &amp; media is probably more important than customisation. (There is no equivalent to iTunes for obtaining Movies, TV shows, and Music in one place on Android outside the US, and many main stream apps appear as iOS first releases in the UK)

I&rsquo;m not convinced of the benefits of the Motorola-Google deal. Patent protection will be good for Android, but it essentially creates a preferred hardware supplier for Android who is US focused. For all that&rsquo;s said, Google management has to report to shareholders who will want to see Google get the most value out of Motorola, and an easy way to do that would be give Motorola an exclusivity period on all future releases of Android.

I&rsquo;ve seen the rumoured Ice Cream Sandwich leak, couple of things make me suspicious;
  Kernel Version; It&rsquo;s the same as the current Gingerbread AOSP build, and all of the 3 Honeycomb devices I have are based on 2.6.36 kernels, not 2.6.35, so it seems odd to me a later Android version would use an earlier kernel.
  Baseband version; It&rsquo;s the same as the current Gingerbread release.

      Disheartened to admit that I&rsquo;ve just had to recommend a current iPhone user upgrades to another iPhone instead of switching to Android.
Reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.
  They&rsquo;re a power user, not a &ldquo;geek&rdquo;, so availability of apps &amp; media is probably more important than customisation. (There is no equivalent to iTunes for obtaining Movies, TV shows, and Music in one place on Android outside the US, and many main stream apps appear as iOS first releases in the UK)

[Update : Jean-Baptiste Queru from Google has confirmed there is some Honeycomb goodness in the AOSP repo which comes from the AOSP repos master branch. It&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;full&rdquo; honeycomb, but a snapshot of master that can be used for recreating a Honeycomb build to test any future incompatibilities against]

The reasons I currently have this view are as follows;
1. It does nothing to help non-Google developers who are currently struggling to make a living from developing Android applications.

As many of you may know my company built and later sold AndAppStore over the course of two years. During that time we kept an eye on the competition and received feedback from users and developers and got a good idea of what both sides wanted. I commented on Google Market because it was the main distribution channel for developers, but I rarely commented on competitors alternative app stores because each of them has their own business plan and all of the legally operating ones seemed to be doing their best to strike a balance between what they need to survive and what users and developers want.

      Since Android 1.6 Google have beenasking developers to use specific size and density groupings for their graphical resources to ensure that their user interfaces looked good on a range of devices, but unfortunately developers are not fully supporting it and now OEMs are making their devices report the wrong densities.
I&rsquo;ve blogged before about developers not supporting the various sizes and densities fully which resulted in UIs which look odd and empty on tablets, but OEMs reporting the wrong densities seems to be a new phenomenon which means even if a developer provided graphic assets for all the screen sizes and densities Android supports they may still see the wrong assets being used and their UI looking odd on some devices through no fault of their own.

For those who don&rsquo;t know my background my involvement with Android started when Dan Morrill demoed Android at the London Google Developer Day in 2008. During his session my brain started ticking and came up with a method of using cryptographic signatures to show approvals and create trust brands so users could tell who thought which apps were &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, I mentioned it to him, he seemed interested, and so I expanded on the idea in a blog post, and from there on I was hooked.

Any healthy community tends to be pyramid shaped when it comes to knowledge and experience. At the bottom are the people who are starting out and have little knowledge or experience of the subject matter, and at the top are the people who&rsquo;ve been involved in the area for a (relatively) long time and have studied it in depth.

Before the Streak developers could pretty much assume that if their app was installed via Google Market any device which reported itself as having low density display (ldpi) had a QVGA screen, any device with a medium density (mdpi) screen had a HVGA screen, and any device with a high density (hdpi) screen had a WVGA screen, and that seemed to work pretty well.

      It&rsquo;s now widely accepted that the economy is undergoing a serious contraction, and so consumers are about to far more picky about what they buy and who they buy it from, so if you&rsquo;re running a business and you don&rsquo;t believe the customer is king then you&rsquo;re most likely to end up seeing your business shrink faster than the economy as a whole.
I&rsquo;ve had numerous experiences over the past few months of companies that seem to think they&rsquo;re doing the customer a favour by taking their money and providing a service, which is a very dangerous thing to do.

My wife and I recently moved into our new house which was built by Crest Nicholson, to start with Crest finished the house over three months later than originally stated, and after a few weeks in the property we have discovered a hole in the concrete kitchen floor, had to have several leaks in the plumbing fixed, we currently have a section of plasterboard missing where the tradespeople put screws through the central heating pipes (three confirmed places, one further suspected hit is to be checked shortly), and we have a surveyors report saying that the paint on the exposed parts of the roof is flaking and will, most likely, cause the wood to rot within the next five years.

Since the &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; the connection has been unreliable to put it politely. The connection drops out at random intervals and this can be part of the way through downloading email, pulling up a web page, or anything.

Experian basically make money from selling other peoples information, but the problem is their information isn&rsquo;t update to date and so they say the house that I&rsquo;ve now been living in for two weeks doesn&rsquo;t exist.

      Sony have been selling the PS3 for some months now as a network enabled home entertainment device, yet it seems to be lacking at least one piece of functionality which is available on Apple TVs that has also been available on Sonys' own PSP for over a year.
There is no doubt that the last firmware update was a big step up for the PS3 as an entertainment center. Upgrading the DVD playback software to do a decent job of upscaling was a good move, and adding the ability to be a DNLA client is also a great boot because it allows users to play movies and music stored on DNLA enabled PCs and storage devices around their network, but the PS3 still lacks the ability to subscribe to Podcasts which the PSP has been able to do for over a year, and it&rsquo;s quite frankly stumped me as to why it&rsquo;s not available.

      I&rsquo;ve often wondered if people who recommend importing devices which are only available in specific countries realise it&rsquo;s a self-defeating practice.
Companies monitor sales through channels, they don&rsquo;t know where the end customers are. So if, for example, there&rsquo;s a product only available in US, and you buy it from a US-based supplier, the company producing that product sees it as a US sale rather than one for the country you&rsquo;re in.

      At #io12 +Hugo Barra announced the new Android Platform Development Kit. The PDK was described as helping hardware developers port Jelly Bean to their devices and was said to be available &ldquo;two to three months before the platform release date&rdquo;, and that selected hardware partners had been given access to the JB PDK a few weeks before #io12 (around the 30min mark in the video below).
Personally I felt it was this years attempt to reassure users their devices would get updates after last years attempt (The 18 month update guarantee) failed so miserably.

      One phrase from last nights +Amazon.com Kindle launch makes me think they&rsquo;re going to take over the #Android tablet space and have big consumer support;
&ldquo;&hellip;people don&rsquo;t want gadgets anymore. They want services that improve over time. They want services that improve every day, every week, and every month.&rdquo;
This has been true for a long time. Consumers buy devices from washing machines to TVs because they want it to do something, not because it has the lastest bit of technology from the manufacturer.

      One of the changes in #IceCreamSandwich was the introduction of a lower SMS usage monitor rate which restricts how many SMSes can be sent by any application in a given time.
My guess would be that the aim is to prevent malicious apps sending huge amounts of SMSes to premium rate numbers, but unfortunately some users seem to be hitting the limit with the default SMS messaging app (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-discuss/bsDO0jQVdTI/Ns7oaTCcIa8J), and it&rsquo;s possible developers may see users complaining about this if their apps rely on SMS usage and are heavily used, so I thought it&rsquo;s worth letting people what the limits are in case people ask them.

      TL;DR: Implementing it in your apps is more hassle than it&rsquo;s worth.
To answer the most common question; Yes, the two apps on one screen functionality of the Galaxy Note 10.1 is limited to a few apps. All of them ship with the device.
The code to support multi-window mode is baked into the core Android framework on the device (so much so that the classes are in the framework library odex), which means that it could be submitted to the #AOSP to become part of Androids core functionality.

Hopefully my posts messing around with the NexusQ have shown you that it is just an #Android device and that most apps would work on it with little to no effort as long as they don&rsquo;t require things like a camera or multi-touch input. If the Q were combined with a simple control system (e.g. an app on the phone which worked as a touchpad for the Q) you&rsquo;d have yourself, in my opinion, one of the best Android living room experiences currently available.

      After chatting with +Billy Rutledge yesterday I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas spinning for how people could use the #NexusQ so I thought I&rsquo;d put them out there as they seem to revolve around one theme; The Q as a hub device.
Multiplayer gaming could use it as the server/co-ordinator for multiple devices running on the same WiFi network so that no-ones individual device needs to be nominated as the primary device (and take the processing hit), and any peer-to-peer co-ordination alogrithms could be offloaded onto the Q creating a star topology instead of a mesh, which tends to be more efficient.

      t&rsquo;s now over 6 months (OK, 6 months and 1 day) since the #GalaxyNexus was launched in the UK.
Even if the Android release cycle was stretched out to one release every 12 months that means we&rsquo;re half way through a release cycle and currently the installed base is around 5% of devices.
5%, or 1 in 20 devices, is a small percentage of the market. To put this in context developers could extend the appeal of their apps to more end users by translating English apps into Korean than by adding ICS features.

With a build problem there may be many error messages, but by focusing on them one at a time in the order they occur you can find that fixing an early build fail also fixes several later ones and so you don&rsquo;t end up wasting time fixing things which are symptoms of a problem rather than the cause.

  Increase the default RAM for your AVDs to 1024MB (yup, 1GB)

      Given the announcement due tomorrow I think we&rsquo;re going to be looking at consumers being able to get their hands on an Ice Cream Sandwich device before developers have had a good chance to play with an SDK, which, just like the last time this happened, is pretty disappointing.
There isn&rsquo;t really anyone who wins from this because it creates a situation where consumers get their new shiny &lsquo;phone only to find out that all the latest features are only supported by a few apps which are either preloaded (in the case of the G-apps), or they come across in Market by chance and are from a select few privileged developers.

  Fragments are the future. If you&rsquo;re writing new code use Fragments. If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.
  Avoid showAsAction=&ldquo;always&rdquo;, Ice Cream Sandwich &lsquo;phones can have small screens and so could be limited on space for options.
  Most of the best apps come from teams with Developers and Designers on them.

      Disheartened to admit that I&rsquo;ve just had to recommend a current iPhone user upgrades to another iPhone instead of switching to Android.
Reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.
  They&rsquo;re a power user, not a &ldquo;geek&rdquo;, so availability of apps &amp; media is probably more important than customisation. (There is no equivalent to iTunes for obtaining Movies, TV shows, and Music in one place on Android outside the US, and many main stream apps appear as iOS first releases in the UK)

      Sony have been selling the PS3 for some months now as a network enabled home entertainment device, yet it seems to be lacking at least one piece of functionality which is available on Apple TVs that has also been available on Sonys' own PSP for over a year.
There is no doubt that the last firmware update was a big step up for the PS3 as an entertainment center. Upgrading the DVD playback software to do a decent job of upscaling was a good move, and adding the ability to be a DNLA client is also a great boot because it allows users to play movies and music stored on DNLA enabled PCs and storage devices around their network, but the PS3 still lacks the ability to subscribe to Podcasts which the PSP has been able to do for over a year, and it&rsquo;s quite frankly stumped me as to why it&rsquo;s not available.

      The problem with RSS and feeds I like RSS as a concept, but, where I&rsquo;ve seen it used, it&rsquo;s always felt like it&rsquo;s missing one thing; the ability to dynamically limit the audience of some posts. This isn&rsquo;t an inherent problem in RSS, but more how it&rsquo;s been used as an all-or-nothing syndication method.
While there are many workarounds (e.g. having separate private feeds, each of which require authentication to access), I haven&rsquo;t found a solution which would seem to work well with a reasonable number of dynamically changing groups.

My company has worked on some Android firmware projects in the past, but, due to the closed source nature of Honeycomb, that work pretty much dried up. Recently though Google released Android 4.0 to the masses and we&rsquo;ve had a few enquiries about firmware work again, so I thought I&rsquo;d see what the current state of building Android was for our default machine configuration.

Some of you may wonder why I&rsquo;ve stopped updating a previous post with the current percentage of votes PortaPayments has in the PayPal X Developers challenge. There&rsquo;s a simple reason; PayPal have taken away the ability to see how many votes have been cast.
Whether this has something to do with a sudden leap of 1,000 cast votes over 24 hours a couple of days ago, or being able to see that even though they sent out an email stating they were aware of &ldquo;Incentivized voting&rdquo; they hadn&rsquo;t actually penalised anyone for it, or it could be related to me pointing out that, at one point, the system was showing more votes than users (despite each user only suppose to be able to cast 1 vote), or possibly even if it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t like the fact people are making stats about voting available, is completely unknown.

      In recent days there the issue of the US patent obtained by Apple relating to the multi-touch functionality has reared it&rsquo;s head on the Android development lists, and the discussions have left me deeply concerned about whether Android will ever become a serious global player in the mobile OS market.
The discussion started rolling when a patch to add multi-touch functionality on Android was posted on the android-platform mailing list, and ran in parallel another list directly discussing the impact the patent may have, but surprisingly ended up with a post from a Google employee saying that patents should not be discussed on any of the google hosted android lists, and this was further expanded by another Google employee saying that it was &ldquo;because of legal repercussions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it is simply best not to know about them&rdquo;.

 One of the things that, on paper, Apache Maven appears to do well is dependency handling. It checks down the dependency chain to verify that libraries versions match up, and that the latest library is used&hellip;.. except with the current repository it isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to work, and you can easily end up with multiple versions of the same jar on your classpath and not know about it.

&ldquo;Introducing the #Google Chrome OS http://bit.ly/N1rNZ&rdquo;
Which started to raise some concerns. It had widely been predicted that we&rsquo;d see Android making it&rsquo;s way onto netbooks in the near future, but with this one announcement that idea has taken a huge knock backwards.
The reason is simple; Androids design is primarily focused on touch screen devices, Chrome OS is focused on netbooks, and netbooks rarely (if ever) have a touch screen.

The first joy is the &ldquo;copy protection&rdquo; offered by Google. Developers can turn this on for their apps but doing so can stop a the application running at all regardless of if it&rsquo;s been copied.

      Recently one of the darlings of Web 2.0 called Twitter has been suffering from growing pains which many attribute to issues coping with it&rsquo;s own popularity.
The guys at Twitter have been open and up-front about their problems, and one thing has come to light, they&rsquo;ve failed to make full use of one of the greatest resources available in software development; Open Source Software.
Twitter isn&rsquo;t alone, many other startups are only making use of OSS at the most basic levels by using Linux, the apache web server, PostgreSQL or MySQL, and a language with a free implementation (such as PHP or Java), without looking further to utilising technologies such as Hibernate, ActiveMQ, and YUI.

Since the &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; the connection has been unreliable to put it politely. The connection drops out at random intervals and this can be part of the way through downloading email, pulling up a web page, or anything.

Currently most build systems have two sources for build dependencies; A remotely hosted source (e.g. maven central, internal build cache on a server), or a local on-disk cache, but many development groups have another potential source which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be being used at the moment; other developers on the same LAN, which is why I started thinking about implementing a peer-to-peer caching system and I&rsquo;m putting the idea out there for discussion.
