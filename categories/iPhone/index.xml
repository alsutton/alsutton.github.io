        <description>Why I recommended an iPhone I&amp;rsquo;m disheartened to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve just had to recommend a current iPhone user upgrades to another iPhone instead of switching to Android.
Reasons high-level reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.
  They&amp;rsquo;re a power user, not a &amp;ldquo;geek&amp;rdquo;, so availability of apps &amp;amp; media is probably more important than customisation. (There is no equivalent to iTunes for obtaining Movies, TV shows, and Music in one place on Android outside the US, and many main stream apps appear as iOS first releases in the UK)</description>

        <description>With my companies Funky Expenses Android applicaion we have two versions; An ad-supported version and a pay-for ad-free version so that users can choose how they help to fund development (yes, we do get requests for a free ad-free version, but unfortunately that won&amp;rsquo;t keep the company afloat). The ad-free version is available from Google Market (which currently has the largest user base by a long way) and AndAppStore, and the pay for version is only available in Google Market.</description>

        <description>(If you want to tweet this please use the tag #O2iPhoneRipOff)
Is it me or is the new O2 iPhone pricing policy looking like a bit of a rip-off?
First off, there is the cost of the &amp;lsquo;phone. At Apples WWDC it was announced that in the US;
3G 8 GB goes from $199 to $99. 3GS 16 GB to be $199 (same as old price for 3G 8GB) 3GS 32 GB to be $299 (same as old price for 3G 16GB).</description>
