        <description>During my morning check of Twitter I came across this tweet from Google;
&amp;ldquo;Introducing the #Google Chrome OS http://bit.ly/N1rNZ&amp;rdquo;
Which started to raise some concerns. It had widely been predicted that we&amp;rsquo;d see Android making it&amp;rsquo;s way onto netbooks in the near future, but with this one announcement that idea has taken a huge knock backwards.
The reason is simple; Androids design is primarily focused on touch screen devices, Chrome OS is focused on netbooks, and netbooks rarely (if ever) have a touch screen.</description>
