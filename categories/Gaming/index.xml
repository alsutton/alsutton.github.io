        <description>[For those that are interested there are some photos of unboxing the PlayTV here ]
The PlayTV arrived today, and what can I say&amp;hellip;.. it&amp;rsquo;s nice, but it&amp;rsquo;s got quite a big design problem; it has no aerial out socket.
Most TV devices have an aerial in and aerial out for the simple reason that it allows you to continue using your TVs functions because you can chain the new device into your aerial feed (i.</description>

        <description>No matter how good you think a CD key generation scheme is there will always be legitimate users who encounter problems. You also have the problem that the key generation scheme will eventually be cracked, CD generators will be made, and you end up with the situation where even if you buy a new copy of the software from the primary distributor you still may not be able to use the software to it&amp;rsquo;s full potential.</description>

      <title>Oh PS3, why do you lack PSP features?</title>

        <description>Sony have been selling the PS3 for some months now as a network enabled home entertainment device, yet it seems to be lacking at least one piece of functionality which is available on Apple TVs that has also been available on Sonys&#39; own PSP for over a year.
There is no doubt that the last firmware update was a big step up for the PS3 as an entertainment center. Upgrading the DVD playback software to do a decent job of upscaling was a good move, and adding the ability to be a DNLA client is also a great boot because it allows users to play movies and music stored on DNLA enabled PCs and storage devices around their network, but the PS3 still lacks the ability to subscribe to Podcasts which the PSP has been able to do for over a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite frankly stumped me as to why it&amp;rsquo;s not available.</description>

        <description>After a few days Wii-ing (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist it), I thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass on some thoughts for those wondering if the new console lives up to the hype&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip;. for hard core gamers it&amp;rsquo;s not the thing to have as your main console. For everyone else is fantastic fun, and even hard core gamers may want one as a second console.
The graphics won&amp;rsquo;t rival an Xbox 360, PS3, or a high-end gaming PC with a recent graphics cards, but thats something that Nintendo have not made a big secret.</description>

        <description>If your remote doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to work after a system update, turn the Wii off for 1 minute then on again at the wall socket.
This should get your Wii working again :)</description>

      <title>Java Games</title>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who&amp;rsquo;ve been using Java long enough to have written it off as not being able to present a good graphical front end, that was until I saw this post at Java Lobby (The video in the post is available directly from YouTube, be aware, it has a techno soundtrack).
None of these cut it against the current generation of PC games, and I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into a few of these games, and some of them semi-cheat by using JNI to call through to native APIs such as OpenGL, so portability is questionable, but the achievements of a working AI, physics, and game processing models at speeds which don&amp;rsquo;t impact gameplay is pretty impressive, particularly as they are not produced by large multi-million dollar games development houses.</description>
