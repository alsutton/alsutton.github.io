        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now widely accepted that the economy is undergoing a serious contraction, and so consumers are about to far more picky about what they buy and who they buy it from, so if you&amp;rsquo;re running a business and you don&amp;rsquo;t believe the customer is king then you&amp;rsquo;re most likely to end up seeing your business shrink faster than the economy as a whole.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had numerous experiences over the past few months of companies that seem to think they&amp;rsquo;re doing the customer a favour by taking their money and providing a service, which is a very dangerous thing to do.</description>

        <description>This is just a warning to anyone out there thinking of purchasing a newly built house; Get a full structural survey!!!!
My wife and I recently moved into our new house which was built by Crest Nicholson, to start with Crest finished the house over three months later than originally stated, and after a few weeks in the property we have discovered a hole in the concrete kitchen floor, had to have several leaks in the plumbing fixed, we currently have a section of plasterboard missing where the tradespeople put screws through the central heating pipes (three confirmed places, one further suspected hit is to be checked shortly), and we have a surveyors report saying that the paint on the exposed parts of the roof is flaking and will, most likely, cause the wood to rot within the next five years.</description>

      <title>Threes&#39; &#34;upgrade&#34; to Turbo Broadband</title>

        <description>In the last few weeks the area I live in has received an &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; to Threes&#39; Turbo broadband service from it&amp;rsquo;s normal 3G service. This is suppose to be a good thing because it would offer more speed, but alas reality is not what Three would have you beleive.
Since the &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; the connection has been unreliable to put it politely. The connection drops out at random intervals and this can be part of the way through downloading email, pulling up a web page, or anything.</description>

      <title>Adobe blatently ripping off customers in the UK</title>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking at Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Dreamweaver CS3 for web development, but they&amp;rsquo;re so blatantly ripping off customers here in the UK that I&amp;rsquo;m going to be looking elsewhere.
The price for DreanWeaver CS3 in the UK is around 390 pounds, the price in the US is 399 dollars (about 200 to 210 pounds). So we&amp;rsquo;re basically being charged twice the price just for living in the UK.
I asked Adobe for details of the reason why I should pay the nearly 200 pound difference and was told the following things (in this order);</description>

        <description>After Orange coming up with a sensible solution to the &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; of not existing in experian and equifaxes databases due to moving to a newly built house, they&amp;rsquo;ve unfortunately shown how not to treat a customer, and here is their special recipe.
In order to prove to Orange that the house I live in existed I was asked to obtain a bank statement which showed my name and the current address.</description>

      <title>Credit Reference Agencies - No substitute for customer service</title>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved into the second house to be finished in a new development and found out that due to a local transmitter the Vodafone signal is so poor that it&amp;rsquo;s barely usable, so I decided to switch to the Orange network (which has good signal strength), but hit a small snag called Experian.
Experian basically make money from selling other peoples information, but the problem is their information isn&amp;rsquo;t update to date and so they say the house that I&amp;rsquo;ve now been living in for two weeks doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description>

      <title>Advertising practices bordering on the dishonest</title>

        <description>Everyone knows that in advertising there is a certain amount of creativity, and that there are bounds to what most companies would consider responsible advertising, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a company which seems to be willing to set the borders of responsible advertising a little wider than most.
Â The company is Crest Nicholson, a UK house builder, who, in web pages that are thinly disguised adverts for two of their developments (here and here) have large glowing quotes about how good these developments are and the company in general.</description>
