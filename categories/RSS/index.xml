      <description>The problem with RSS and feeds I like RSS as a concept, but, where I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it used, it&amp;rsquo;s always felt like it&amp;rsquo;s missing one thing; the ability to dynamically limit the audience of some posts. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an inherent problem in RSS, but more how it&amp;rsquo;s been used as an all-or-nothing syndication method.
While there are many workarounds (e.g. having separate private feeds, each of which require authentication to access), I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a solution which would seem to work well with a reasonable number of dynamically changing groups.</description>
