      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of different approaches to building programs, and between writing about the specifications of an Android firmware build machine, and how to create a cost-effective build farm, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be worth covering a few things that I believe are important when trying to create a scalable build for your software.
What is a &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo;? When I talk about a build I mean the instructions that tell a machine how to take your source code and create an executable program.</description>

      <description>The idea
Currently most build systems have two sources for build dependencies; A remotely hosted source (e.g. maven central, internal build cache on a server), or a local on-disk cache, but many development groups have another potential source which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be being used at the moment; other developers on the same LAN, which is why I started thinking about implementing a peer-to-peer caching system and I&amp;rsquo;m putting the idea out there for discussion.</description>
