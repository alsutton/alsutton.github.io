      One phrase from last nights +Amazon.com Kindle launch makes me think they&rsquo;re going to take over the #Android tablet space and have big consumer support;
&ldquo;&hellip;people don&rsquo;t want gadgets anymore. They want services that improve over time. They want services that improve every day, every week, and every month.&rdquo;
This has been true for a long time. Consumers buy devices from washing machines to TVs because they want it to do something, not because it has the lastest bit of technology from the manufacturer.

      After making yesterdays post on how to build the Android Open Source Project master branch using Mac OS X 10.7 and Xcode 4 I&rsquo;ve tracked down what&rsquo;s necessary to get the Ice Cream Sandwich branch of AOSP compiling on the same platform.
This process has been tested against the android-4.0.3_r1 branch, so if you&rsquo;re using another branch you may encounter some issues not mentioned here.
  Follow steps 1 to 4 from the instructions from yesterdays post, but check out the relevant ICS branch instead of master (Don&rsquo;t forget to apply the patches from that post to the checked out ICS files).

My company has worked on some Android firmware projects in the past, but, due to the closed source nature of Honeycomb, that work pretty much dried up. Recently though Google released Android 4.0 to the masses and we&rsquo;ve had a few enquiries about firmware work again, so I thought I&rsquo;d see what the current state of building Android was for our default machine configuration.

      After seeing a twitter post asking about HTTP MultiPart on Android which linked to a Google Groups thread which recommended a solution which required the inclusion of multiple libraries, I thought it might be worth sharing a method I&rsquo;ve used in the past which can be used reasonably easily and doesn&rsquo;t require tens of kilobytes of unused library functions to be added to your app.
First off you&rsquo;ll need the AOSP source which can be obtained from an unofficial mirror in the absence of the primary official repository at kernel.

Reasons high-level reasons were;
  They already know iOS, so little to no learning curve.

I&rsquo;m not convinced of the benefits of the Motorola-Google deal. Patent protection will be good for Android, but it essentially creates a preferred hardware supplier for Android who is US focused. For all that&rsquo;s said, Google management has to report to shareholders who will want to see Google get the most value out of Motorola, and an easy way to do that would be give Motorola an exclusivity period on all future releases of Android.

I&rsquo;ve seen the rumoured Ice Cream Sandwich leak, couple of things make me suspicious;
  Kernel Version; It&rsquo;s the same as the current Gingerbread AOSP build, and all of the 3 Honeycomb devices I have are based on 2.6.36 kernels, not 2.6.35, so it seems odd to me a later Android version would use an earlier kernel.
  Baseband version; It&rsquo;s the same as the current Gingerbread release.

The new Android Market client recently started to roll out and looks like this;
I can&rsquo;t help feeling the following tweaks to the new non-US Market layout might be useful;
  Change the &ldquo;Staff Choices&rdquo; button to an &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; button
  Put &ldquo;Staff Choices&rdquo; where the current &ldquo;Editors Choice&rdquo; is
  Put the &ldquo;Editors Choice&rdquo; where they Grey featured app block is (Where the pageonce app is in the screenshot), and rename it &ldquo;More Featured Apps.

      After checking over the Android Open Source Project repository I noticed an interesting comment in the manifests project;
which made me wonder if some of the Honeycomb source code had been dropped into the AOSP repository, and, well, it looks like it may have done.
[Update : Jean-Baptiste Queru from Google has confirmed there is some Honeycomb goodness in the AOSP repo which comes from the AOSP repos master branch. It&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;full&rdquo; honeycomb, but a snapshot of master that can be used for recreating a Honeycomb build to test any future incompatibilities against]

      Yesterday the Wall Street Journal ran a story about Google planning to hire Android application developers which, to me, seems to have the potential to be the worst possible thing they could do to the Android eco-system. I&rsquo;m going to outline the reasons why I hold this view but I&rsquo;m always open to other, well reasoned, points of view.
The reasons I currently have this view are as follows;
1. It does nothing to help non-Google developers who are currently struggling to make a living from developing Android applications.

By default the Honeycomb AVD is created to emulate 256MB of RAM, my advice is to increase this significantly.

As many of you may know my company built and later sold AndAppStore over the course of two years. During that time we kept an eye on the competition and received feedback from users and developers and got a good idea of what both sides wanted. I commented on Google Market because it was the main distribution channel for developers, but I rarely commented on competitors alternative app stores because each of them has their own business plan and all of the legally operating ones seemed to be doing their best to strike a balance between what they need to survive and what users and developers want.

      Since Android 1.6 Google have beenasking developers to use specific size and density groupings for their graphical resources to ensure that their user interfaces looked good on a range of devices, but unfortunately developers are not fully supporting it and now OEMs are making their devices report the wrong densities.
I&rsquo;ve blogged before about developers not supporting the various sizes and densities fully which resulted in UIs which look odd and empty on tablets, but OEMs reporting the wrong densities seems to be a new phenomenon which means even if a developer provided graphic assets for all the screen sizes and densities Android supports they may still see the wrong assets being used and their UI looking odd on some devices through no fault of their own.

Unfortunately it seems they&rsquo;re heading in the wrong direction.
The biggest backwards step is the removal of landscape mode.

      Today is a sad day for me as I&rsquo;ve decided to greatly reduce my involvement in the Android community, and I thought it best to explain why rather than leave the rumour mill to run its' course.
For those who don&rsquo;t know my background my involvement with Android started when Dan Morrill demoed Android at the London Google Developer Day in 2008. During his session my brain started ticking and came up with a method of using cryptographic signatures to show approvals and create trust brands so users could tell who thought which apps were &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, I mentioned it to him, he seemed interested, and so I expanded on the idea in a blog post, and from there on I was hooked.

      In the last day or two lots of people have helped circulate a link to an O&rsquo;Reilly effort to create a cookbook of community supplied Android examples, which is a noble effort, but there is a big drawback; and that&rsquo;s the potential quality of the information.
Any healthy community tends to be pyramid shaped when it comes to knowledge and experience. At the bottom are the people who are starting out and have little knowledge or experience of the subject matter, and at the top are the people who&rsquo;ve been involved in the area for a (relatively) long time and have studied it in depth.

      When the Dell Streak was first launched there was an aspect of it that caught me off guard, its' pixel density, and it would appear I&rsquo;m not alone.
Before the Streak developers could pretty much assume that if their app was installed via Google Market any device which reported itself as having low density display (ldpi) had a QVGA screen, any device with a medium density (mdpi) screen had a HVGA screen, and any device with a high density (hdpi) screen had a WVGA screen, and that seemed to work pretty well.
