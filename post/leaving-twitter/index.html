            <p>12 days after being told by my EM it could happen, something I&rsquo;ve been expecting to happen for a few weeks 
has finally happened. Today I was told it is my last day working at Twitter.My EM hadn&rsquo;t been inviting me 
to strategy meetings, afaik no-one has been offered a job on the team I was supposed to be seeding 
(apologies to those I referred), and, in my last few weeks, I was tasked with creating dashboards for 
management. The signs of the end were there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very surprised if another staff engineer is offered the same role that was sold to me last year (and 
flabbergasted if they were outside the US) because part of what I supported as &ldquo;best for the business&rdquo; made 
a large part of that role unnecessary in the org it was in.</p>
<p>I feel a bit cheated because letting me go now means I leave with <em>zero</em> shares and <em>zero</em> bonus. Two weeks 
later I&rsquo;d have had a 5 figure share grant, a few weeks after that I could be looking at a similar 5 figure 
bonus. Honestly I would have been financially better off by just staying at Google.</p>
<p>A couple of folk asked how this happened; The key things were a share vesting cliff (before which you
receive no shares), and a contract clause which offers &ldquo;payment in lieu of notice&rdquo; (which means your 
termination date can be immediate, so you&rsquo;re not employed on a pay-out date even if your notice 
period would mean you cross it). With these two things I was told today was my last day and that
I wouldn&rsquo;t be eligible to receive either the shares or the bonus.</p>
<p>Still there&rsquo;s no point on dwelling on it. There are some great folk there, but there are also some things 
which I didn&rsquo;t like, and I felt I learnt a more useful things in 6 months at Google, Deliveroo, or Facebook 
than I did at Twitter, so maybe this is a good thing after all.</p>
