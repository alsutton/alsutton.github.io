      <p>First off the good. <a href="http://www.appbackr.com/">AppBackr</a>. They came second, and as far as I&rsquo;m aware they didn&rsquo;t break any rules. I&rsquo;ve personally sent them a congratulatory message and everyone who took part in making <a href="http://www.portapayments.com/">PortaPayments</a> sees them as a honest, worthy winner.  In the future I&rsquo;d have no problems in working with them to help them help apps get funded with a tie-up via <a href="http://andappstore.com/">AndAppStore</a> or help getting the word out to Android developers.</p>
<p>Now the bad, Rentalic. They won first prize yet right from the start we <a href="http://blog.alsutton.com/reference-material/paypal-x-challenge/">identified them as being non-compliant with the contest rules</a> (they&rsquo;re entry D914), so to us they shouldn&rsquo;t have been in the voting let alone have walked away with US$50,000 in cash and been given US$50,000 in fees.</p>
<p>What was wrong with Rentalic?, well, it&rsquo;s their feature video. The video shown at the top of their entry is a very slick piece of advertising but failed to show a user using their application, which was a clearly stated requirement in the competition rules (in fact we couldn&rsquo;t even find a single screen shot of their application in the video). There is a second video linked to in the description, but that&rsquo;s 1:54 long, so pulling it into the main feature video would create a feature video of 3 minutes 23 seconds, which is well above the 2 minute limit PayPal stated in the rules &amp; in emails sent to entrants, and so combining the two would have also make them ineligible.</p>
<p>The reason why this is a problem?, that&rsquo;s all to do with the initial round of the competition which was a basic popularity contest. Many entries were trying to win a popularity contest with a &ldquo;rules-compliant&rdquo; video which showed real-world footage of users using their applications to ensure they complied with the rules. Rentalic didn&rsquo;t and just used a high quality cartoon advert as the feature video, which is the one most people would have based their voting on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of the entries could have come up with equally impressive pieces of marketing if they&rsquo;d decided not to meet the requirement about including actual usage footage in their feature video, and/or skip the one about total feature video time not exceeding 2 minutes, but the rules said you couldn&rsquo;t, and many entries stuck to the rules, and thus were at a disadvantage from the start.</p>
<p>So the end result; The competition was won by an entry with a TV-worthy feature video which didn&rsquo;t comply with the competition rules. Given <a href="http://blog.alsutton.com/2010/03/05/and-on-the-last-day/">our experience of the PayPal X contest</a> its' not a huge surprise that a non-compliant entry won, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, at some point in the future, an announcement is made of an investment in, or a purchase of, rentalic by eBay, PayPal or another company/person involved in the funding, running, or organisation of the contest.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update :</strong> It&rsquo;s been suggested to me that Rentalic might be a copy of Rentoid. Rentoid.com was registered in early 2007 and Rentalic.com in late 2008, so it looks like PayPals &ldquo;contest that rewards innovative apps&rdquo;  may have been won by a copy of a 3+ year old idea]</p>
