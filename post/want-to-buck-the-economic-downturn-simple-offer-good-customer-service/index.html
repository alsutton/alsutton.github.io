      <p>It&rsquo;s now widely accepted that the economy is undergoing a serious contraction, and so consumers are about to far more picky about what they buy and who they buy it from, so if you&rsquo;re running a business and you don&rsquo;t believe the customer is king then you&rsquo;re most likely to end up seeing your business shrink faster than the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had numerous experiences over the past few months of companies that seem to think they&rsquo;re doing the customer a favour by taking their money and providing a service, which is a very dangerous thing to do. Some examples of companies with serious customer service problems are;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Crest Nicholson, who built the house I live in, and over a month after the &ldquo;Completion of construction&rdquo; certificate was issued I still am waiting for a part of my lounge to be plastered, the front and rear doors to be replaced due to problems, and I have two 20+ page reports from my surveyor indicating that the workmanship is little better than you would get from a DIY enthusiast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BT who stated they would provide me with a working land line on the 11th of March, then didn&rsquo;t and I had to call them to find out why, then said it would be done on the 20th of March, and again didn&rsquo;t and I had to call them, and now say that it should be done by the 15th of April.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange who wouldn&rsquo;t provide a 15 pounds a month &lsquo;phone service despite being given the offer of me paying several months in advance, and instead wanted me to use a pay as you go tariff which would make them more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DFS who stated approximately 6 weeks delivery for two items, then rejected both of them from their supplier twice even though one of the two items was fine, and then, after 9 weeks, said that the order couldn&rsquo;t be cancelled (fortunately the manager of the shop seemed to be aware that under UK law you can cancel an order if it&rsquo;s not delivered on time).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this I will never buy a new home again (and probably never but a Crest Nicholson home unless it&rsquo;s 20 years old and someone else has fixed the problems), I&rsquo;m with O2 as a phone service, and DFS have had my order cancelled and I won&rsquo;t buy from them again. I&rsquo;m also letting anyone who asks know about the joys I&rsquo;ve had with these companies, so it&rsquo;s not just my custom they&rsquo;re losing, they&rsquo;re are now other people who won&rsquo;t buy from them because they don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassles I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>So remember, even if you don&rsquo;t like it, the customer is king, and when the economy takes a downturn if you don&rsquo;t at least make them feel respected then get ready to see your business start to fade away.</p>
