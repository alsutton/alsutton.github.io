      <p>After an attempt to do a 170 mile round trip in my Nissan Leaf, 
it has now been consigned to a life of “less than 100-mile total distance” trips only.</p>
<p>The first leg was fine up until the charge point. The initially selected
<a href="https://instavolt.co.uk/">InstaVolt</a> charger was “temporarily out of service”, 
and a nearby <a href="https://www.chargeyourcar.org.uk/">ChargeYourCar</a> charger was 
unfathomable to get working as the “Pay by Phone” phone number on the unit 
wasn’t working.</p>
<p><img src="/images/20211226-1.jpg" alt="Chargers can become &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; at short notice"></p>
<p>Thirty minutes after getting to the first charger, after some searching on
<a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zap Map</a>, we ended up at a nearby 
<a href="https://www.bppulse.co.uk/">BP Pulse</a> station where I could put some charge 
back in the car. Fifteen minutes later, with about 60%, 
and a queue forming at the charger, we went to our destination, arriving half an hour late.</p>
<p>We made a 10ish mile round trip for lunch, and then headed back to the
BP Pulse charger to top up to 80%. This gave us an estimated 110 miles 
of range for an 80-mile trip… unfortunately that wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>About half-way around the M25 motorway I noticed our 30-mile buffer was now 
down to 12 miles, and at the rate it was decreasing we wouldn’t make it home.
So, after a few miles of “Heater off” driving, we made an un-planned for 10+
minute stop at an <a href="https://electrichighway.gridserve.com/">Electric Highway</a> 
charger to put an extra 30% charge in the battery.</p>
<p>The Electric Highway app is a mess, and is typical of the state of 
many charger apps - Wildly unfriendly for the user. In the EH app
the registration flow is broken and shows
white text on a white background, but, fortunately the tap-and-pay 
gave us enough to get home, and I didn&rsquo;t need to play &ldquo;Guess where the right
option is&rdquo; in their registration flow.</p>
<p><img src="/images/20211226-2.jpg" alt="Electric Highway App"></p>
<p>In all we spent roughly fourty minutes looking for and driving to chargers, and 
around fourty-five minutes charging, which doubled the journey time we used 
to have in a combustion engine car.</p>
<p>That kind of time penalty is unreasonable for most folk.</p>
<p>Should I have spent ~£7,000 more for a bigger battery? Possibly, but even 
in a 62kWh leaf there’d still be about 30 minutes charging time and the 
30 minutes “usable charger” hunt. Other longer range options were even 
more expensive, which made them unjustifiable.</p>
<p>Is this a regular trip? We do it once every couple of months. To me a car 
with a <a href="https://ev-database.uk/car/1106/Nissan-Leaf">95 mile worst case real world range</a>
should be able to cope with a 170-mile trip with a single 
en-route charge, but it’s clear it isn’t, and it&rsquo;s
now clear to me that the EV charging infrastructure doesn&rsquo;t support current EV
users well, and is certainly going to struggle to meet demand as 
even more EVs hit the UKs roads.</p>
