            <p>I&rsquo;ve been asked how I tracked down an AOSP build issue on OS X (<a href="http://goo.gl/J9mOL),">http://goo.gl/J9mOL),</a> so I thought it might be worth putting the process up here so others can get an idea of whats involved;</p>
<ol>
<li>I picked the first error which was stopping the build. With a build problem there may be many error messages, but by focusing on them one at a time in the order they occur you can find that fixing an early build fail also fixes several later ones and so you don&rsquo;t end up wasting time fixing things which are symptoms of a problem rather than the cause.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case the first problem was an undefined symbol;</p>
<p>Undefined symbols for architecture i386:
&ldquo;llvm::Module::dump() const&rdquo;, referenced from:
glsl_ir_to_llvm_module(exec_list*, llvm::Module*, GGLState const*, char const*)in libMesa.a(ir_to_llvm.o)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I found where the build failed by running a single threaded build (i.e. do not use -j when making) and looking for the last build message before the failure which, in this case, was;</li>
</ol>
<p>host Executable: mesa (out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/mesa)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I found the module where the build command is created. I did this by grepping the android build files for mesa using this command;</li>
</ol>
<p>find . -name Android.mk | xargs grep mesa</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This gave you a module to rebuild to reproduce the problem. In this case the output included the following;</li>
</ol>
<p>./external/mesa3d/test/Android.mk:LOCAL_MODULE := mesa</p>
<p>which meant I could reproduce the build problem using;</p>
<p>make clean ; make mesa</p>
<p>Note : Most problems will limited to that project (in this case external/mesa3d). Unfortunately in this case it was a little more complex.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>I could see that llvm::Module was not defined in the mesa3d project, which indicated the compile error was a symptom of an earlier problem, so I the showcommands make target to give me a complete build dump;</li>
</ol>
<p>make clean ; make showcommands mesa</p>
<p>Warning: This generates a lot of output. In this case the command which was causing the build to fail was;</p>
<p>g++ -o out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/mesa -headerpad_max_install_names -Lout/host/darwin-x86/obj/lib -m32 out/host/darwin-x86/obj/lib/libbcc.dylib out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/egl.o out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/main.o out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/cmain.o out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/mesa_intermediates/m_matrix.o out/host/darwin-x86/obj/STATIC_LIBRARIES/libMesa_intermediates/libMesa.a -Wl,-undefined,error -lpthread -ldl</p>
<p>As I knew that the location of the definition of llvm::Module wasn&rsquo;t in the mesa3d project I knew that the problem must be in one of the other referenced libraries. With this build line I could see that the only library built during the AOSP build that wasn&rsquo;t in the mesa project was libbcc, so I looked for where that was built using a simliar command line to step 3;</p>
<p>find . -name Android.mk | xargs grep libbcc</p>
<p>which had the following line in its output;</p>
<p>./frameworks/compile/libbcc/Android.mk:LOCAL_MODULE := libbcc</p>
<p>so my attention switched to frameworks/compile/libbcc.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>I checked the libbcc projects for references to external/llvm (where the missing symbol was defined) and found;</li>
</ol>
<p>Android.mk:include $(LLVM_ROOT_PATH)/llvm-device-build.mk
Android.mk:include $(LLVM_ROOT_PATH)/llvm-host-build.mk</p>
<p>which indicated I was in the right place.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>I have access to a copy of gitweb configured for the AOSP source code so I was able to see from that there were only a few commits in the frameworks/compile/libbcc project which were only on master, so I decided I&rsquo;d try to roll back the last few commits one-by-one. This is a bit of a heavy handed approach, but I could see libbcc was the problem (because it was the only non-mesa built library), I knew that this was a problem which had started recently, and I believed stepping back through a few most recent checkins would be quicker than analysing each patch and it&rsquo;s effect on the build process (especially given my lack of familiarity with libbcc and mesa).</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s always worth looking through the patches in case anything pops out at you as being wrong, but in this case there was nothing obvious I could see.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>I cycled through git checkout [commit_id] in the libbcc project and then make clean ; make mesa going back through each commit in the log until the compile completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I posted the email showing which commit to checkout to fix the build problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
