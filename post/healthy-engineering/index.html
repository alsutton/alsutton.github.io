      <h2 id="ideas-for-a-healthier-engineering-environment">Ideas for a healthier engineering environment</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had good and bad work experiences, but how many of us are
learning from them? Having recently left Deliveroo I decided to put together some things I thought
were good engineering guidelines based on the experiences I&rsquo;ve had at several companies so I could
try to find a future workplace which was in-line with my ideal way of working.</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<h4 id="dont-assume-you-have-complete-knowledge">Don&rsquo;t assume you have complete knowledge</h4>
<p>No-one is part of every conversation in a company, and very few, if any, engineers remember
every fact from every conversation they have, so assuming you know all of the reasons behind
someones actions is always going to lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in something find out about it. If you don&rsquo;t agree with something try and
find out why it is the way it is. Both of those are great ways to learn new things.</p>
<h4 id="consider-the-views-of-others">Consider the views of others</h4>
<p>All code gets rewritten at some point, so people who are defensive over their code or 
their views just because it&rsquo;s their code or views tend to slow down innovation.</p>
<p>If someone comes up with an idea that&rsquo;s not great then it&rsquo;s usually either through lack of their own
education, or because they are aware of something that others are, either way that&rsquo;s useful 
to know. If they haven&rsquo;t fully understood the reasoning behind a choice, help them, and future engineers
understand why the choice was made by documenting it in an accesible way, or, if they do have 
additional information which wasn&rsquo;t considered during the decision making process, take a step 
back and see if it could change the outcome and make the product even better.</p>
<h4 id="unblock-others-to-help-everyone-move-forward-faster">Unblock others to help everyone move forward faster</h4>
<p>Start your day seeing if what you&rsquo;re doing is the most efficient thing to get the team moving
forwards. Are your colleagues waiting for someone to review their code? then go do it! Is someone
struggling with a problem? see if you can help! Even if it&rsquo;s offering to get lunch for someone who&rsquo;s
slammed with work it can help. Don&rsquo;t assume that cutting code is the most impactful thing you can do.</p>
<h4 id="dont-create-unnecessary-code">Don&rsquo;t create unnecessary code</h4>
<p>A lot have problems already been solved, so you should ask yourself at the start of any project &ldquo;If
we build something new, what will make it better than existing solutions?&rdquo;. Could you buy or license
a solution which will do everything you need? Can you contribute to a project to make it a better
fit for the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve? If you&rsquo;re part of a team, and the only reason you can
come up with is &ldquo;Because I want to learn X&rdquo;, that might not be a reason to put X into production.</p>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find this list useful in either finding a great place to work, or helping the place
you are currently working become even better.</p>
