      </div><p>Having been a mobile &lsquo;phone owner for more than a couple of decades, and recently
&ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; to a Pixel 6 due to my old Pixel 3 going out of the security update
support, I have to say I&rsquo;m disappointed with where we&rsquo;re at with Android phones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing code for Android since its public release. I owned a G1, I&rsquo;ve
owned companies which helped device manufacturers, so I understand some of the
challenges. With all this knowledge I still feel we&rsquo;re falling short of where
Android could have been.</p>
<p>The first, and most glaring, problem is battery life. Googles&rsquo; flagship phone,
the Pixel 6, has, as a hero feature, the ability to last a day without a charge.
This is 10+ years after folk measured standby time in weeks, and at a time where
iPhone users expect more than this to the point Apple don&rsquo;t consider it a feature
worth advertising.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-pixel6-advert.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The whole buying and setup experience was also well below what I expect from
a &ldquo;Tier-1&rdquo; tech center of excellence that Google is supposed to be. Everything
from the Google store being unable to take orders and showing a variety of errors
through to the setup experience eroded my confidence in the product and
Google as a supplier.</p>
<p><img src="/images/202110-GoogleStore.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Setting up the device was an equally disappointing experience. The device
defaulted to using <code>English (United States)</code>, even though my device was 
bought in, and being setup, in the UK. The option to correct this mistake
was a couple of levels deep in a setting, and, given the device is equipped
with a GPS receiver, isn&rsquo;t something I would have expected to have to go
looking for.</p>
<p>Continuing on through the setup I hit multiple issues. From the device reporting
it couldn&rsquo;t connect to my network, and then saying it was already connected, 
through to the Play Store saying apps were downloading when they weren&rsquo;t
(or at least they didn&rsquo;t complete downloading for 15 hours on a high speed
WiFi connection), and on to the home screen appearing underneath the lock 
screen when the device was locked.</p>
<p><img src="/images/202110-Screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was made aware that there was a firmware update for the device (<code>SD1A.210817.036</code>), 
but  that update didn&rsquo;t reach my device until multiple days after 
I received it, meaning I couldn&rsquo;t upgrade for the &ldquo;Out Of Box&rdquo; experience,
and I was left with what appears to be a buggy firmware (<code>SD1A.210817.015.A4</code>)</p>
<p>To me this all demonstrates Googles lack of investment in Android, and 
why folk continue to choose iOS over Android for reasons of quality&hellip; 
and that frustrates the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Sitting in pre-launch Android development meet-up that Google arranged 
in London in 2008 there seemed to be a lot of hope. Now  it seems 
Android has become a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; product that will always be rough 
around the edges .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hoping that, given Android Automotive OS in cars is in 
the same place Android was in &lsquo;phones a decade ago, we can avoid 
the choices which left us with a single primary source of the OS 
distribution (i.e. a monopoly) where the distributor is happy 
with &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;.</p>
