      <p>After spending 3 weeks not having a house (due to legal delays during the purchase) I should be reunited with all my tech this weekend in the new house, so I thought it might be worth reflecting on some of the changes made to accommodate life on the road.</p>
<p>My normal tech set-up included a hefty Mac Pro (8 cores, 32GB of RAM), a Subversion server, multiple Time Capsules (one per machine I have), so it&rsquo;s just not practical to take all of that on the road.</p>
<p>First off I needed something more portable than the Mac Pro. My choices were an 8GB 2009 Macbook Pro or a 4GB 2010 Macbook Air. I did have a Chromebook and Windows laptop available to me, but Chromebooks don&rsquo;t have mature Android development tools, and I&rsquo;m now a Mac Man so the transition to Windows would have hurt my productivity to much.</p>
<p>In the end I chose the Macbook Air. It has a higher resolution the the Macbook pro and is more portable. I&rsquo;ve not regretted the choice, it&rsquo;s done everything I needed, and although compiling Android from the AOSP repo was a slower I still ended up with a perfectly usable image.</p>
<p>Next on the hit list was backups. I decided to go with an encrypted sparsebundle on a paid Dropbox account (<a href="http://db.tt/HYbgib1">http://db.tt/HYbgib1</a>) to cover this. This gave me enough space for my important data whilst still maintaining a reasonable level of security. As well as adding security to the standard dropbox setup the added bonus of using a sparsebundle was that it ensured that only changed sections of filesystem needed to be replicated back to the dropbox servers which lowered my bandwidth costs.</p>
<p>OS X 10.7&rsquo;s recovery partition gave me some comfort about not needing to back up the whole OS and moving to apps available via Apples Mac Store gave me reassurance I wouldn&rsquo;t have to go hunting down disks or license keys after a restore, but I know that a total machine failure would have taken me a lot longer to recover from.</p>
<p>Next up was to moving the source code repositories from the Subversion server to GitHub. GitHub offer paid accounts (<a href="http://goo.gl/oEYm1">http://goo.gl/oEYm1</a>) which provide private repositories to keep the non-open source stuff I work on, and the Git tools in Eclipse now seem to be mature enough to rely on for every day heavy development.</p>
<p>As for my mail, calendaring, etc., well, that was already with Google, so there wasn&rsquo;t any need to change anything, and it&rsquo;s done everything I&rsquo;ve needed on the road.</p>
<p>Finally there was the fundamental need for any cloud based setup; Internet access. I&rsquo;ve mainly been using a ZTE MF10 and HSDPA+ dongle from Three UK, and I&rsquo;ve been impressed. I&rsquo;ve achieved download speeds which equalled or bettered my old ADSL connection, but the only downside has been cost. The biggest problem though is I typically use 30 to 40 GB per month, which would cost well over £100 on Pay As You Go, or would involve a number of dongle changes and multiple contracts because Three top their contracts out at 15GB :(.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been sneaking into Starbucks Coffee on an infrequent basis to make use of their free WiFi, and was pretty happy to be able to download the 1.2GB OS X 10.7.3 combo patch for the price of a cappuccino (and get some coffee thrown in :)). A coffee shop with free WiFi is now firmly in my list of things to check for when I&rsquo;m on the road.</p>
<p>So looking back, will I change anything back?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving back to the Mac Pro, that&rsquo;s a no brainer, but it is nice to know that the MBA is capable of taking pretty much anything I throw at it. I had previously had situations where I&rsquo;d been deciding between the MBP and MBA on the basis I was concerned with the MBAs memory, but after eliminating my need for VirtualBox to do AOSP compiles (yup, that&rsquo;s what those Xmas AOSP check-ins were about), I think the MBP can be put into a box with the sign saying &ldquo;Open in case of MacBook Air loss&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add the Time Capsules back in because I like having large local backups which I can restore from quickly. Using Dropbox (or an equivalent) for hundreds of GBs' isn&rsquo;t practical in the UK, but it will always be in the mix and will cover my off-site backup needs.</p>
<p>The cost of UK cellular broadband means that I&rsquo;ll be heading back to a landline connection soon. This isn&rsquo;t going to be immediate because &ldquo;Fibre to the Cabinet&rdquo; is being rolled out, and a few more weeks of being careful with will be a bit taxing, but will be made worth while by a cheap 40MB/s connection.</p>
<p>As for subversion; That&rsquo;s history.</p>
